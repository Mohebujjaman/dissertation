\chapter[Toward Preventing Server-Side XSS]{Toward Preventing Server-Side XSS via Automatic Code and Data Separation}
\label{dedacota}

Automatically finding vulnerabilities, as we have done in the previous
chapters, is a great way to find vulnerabilities in web applications.
However, there is always the risk that the automated tools do not find
a vulnerability, and these tools give no guarantees that all
vulnerabilities are found. Another avenue to secure web applications
from attack is to write the application in such a way as to make
vulnerabilities impossible. In this chapter, we examine Cross-Site
Scripting vulnerabilities as having the root cause of Code and Data
mixing. By properly applying the basic security principles of Code and
Data separation we can automatically prevent a wide swath of
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
