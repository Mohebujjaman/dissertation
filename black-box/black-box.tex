\chapter{An Analysis of Black-Box Web Application Vulnerability Scanners}
\label{why-johnny-cant-pentest}

First, we will turn our attention to the problem of black-box web
application vulnerabilities scanners---that is, automated tools that
attempt to find security vulnerabilities in web applications. The goal
of this chapter is study the current state of black-box web
application vulnerability scanners.

\chapter{A State-Aware Black-Box Web Vulnerability Scanner}
\label{enemy-of-the-state}

We identified the biggest problem common to black-box web application
vulnerability scanners in the previous chapter: The scanners treat the
web application as if it was a web site, and ignore the fact that it
is an \emph{application} with state. In this chapter, we describe
methods and approaches to automatically infer the state of a web
application in a black-box manner, and we apply this to a black-box
web application vulnerability scanner.
