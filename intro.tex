\chapter{Introduction}

Web applications are a fundamental part of our lives and culture. We
use web applications in almost every facet of society: socializing,
banking, health, taxes, learning, and news, to name a few. These web
applications are always available from anywhere with an Internet
connection, and they enable us to communicate and collaborate at a
speed that was unthinkable just a few decades ago.

The shift to have more and more of our lives and data move to web
applications unfortunately motivates hackers to attack web
applications. In 2011, hackers stole 1 million usernames and passwords
from Sony. In 2008, hackers stole 45 million customer credit cards
from TJ Maxx. In 2009, hackers stole 100 million customer credit cards
from Heartland Payment Systems. In 2012, hackers stole 24,000
Bitcoins\footnote{These Bitcoins are worth about \$10 million at this
  time of writing.} from BitFloor, a major Bitcoin exchange. What all
of these instances have in common is that hackers exploited
vulnerabilities in a web application in order to steal either
usernames and passwords, credit cards, or Bitcoins.

It is insightful to turn our attention to \emph{why} web applications
have so many vulnerabilities. Those same properties that make web
applications so attractive to users also attract hackers. A web
application never closes, so they are always available for hackers.
Web applications also house a vast treasure-trove of data, which
hackers can use for monetary gain. Finally, as we will explore in the
next section, web applications are a complex hodgepodge of various
technologies. This complexity, combined with the intense time-to-market
pressure of web applications\footnote{Facebook's moto is: Move fast
  and break things.}, is a breeding ground for bugs and
vulnerabilities. 

The situation is dire. We must focus on new ways to secure web
applications from attack. We must develop new tools in order to find
the vulnerabilities before a hacker does. We must, because web
applications and they data we store on them are too important.

\section{History of Web Applications}

The World Wide Web was created by Sir.\ Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 as a
means of sharing information for the CERN research organization. What
began is a means of sharing simple hyper-linked textual documents,
quickly exploded in popularity over the proceeding years.

The core of the web has remained relatively the same throughout the
years: a web browser (operated by a user) connects to a web server
using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The web server then
sends back a response, typically in the form of a HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) page. The web browser then parses the raw HTML page to
turn it into a GUI that is displayed to the user. The fundamental
underlying principle, and the definition of HyperText, is that an HTML
page contains links to \emph{other} HTML pages.

The beginning of the web was envisioned as a set of documents with
links pointing to other documents. In other words, the web was mostly
a set of read-only documents (from the perspective of the user with
the web browser). This is where the term \emph{web sites} comes from:
a web site is typically thought of as a collection of documents that
exist under the same domain name.

As the web evolved, web sites started to shift from static, read-only
documents. Developers realized that the HTML response returned to the
client could be dynamic---that is, the content of the HTML response
could vary pragmatically. This shift in thinking caused web sites to
transition to \emph{web applications} which emulated features of
traditional desktop applications. Web applications enabled scenarios
that caused the web's popular to increase: e-commerce, news sites, and
web-based email. It is hard to overstate the impact that web
applications had on the uptake of the web. 

Now, with web applications, the architecture of the web changed
slightly. When the web browser makes an HTTP request to the server,
instead of returning a static HTML response, the web server typically
will invoke server-side code. This server-side code is responsible for
returning a response, typically HTML, to the browser. The server-side
code can use any number of inputs to determine the response, but the
typical set-up is that the server-side reads the parameters sent in
the browser's HTTP request, consults an SQL database, and returns an
HTML response. 

This architecture of a web application is what we will use throughout
this chapter to discuss the security aspects of web applications.

\section{Web Application Vulnerabilities}

The security properties of a web application are similar to the
security of any other application: confidentially of the data,
integrity of the data, and availability of the application. In this
dissertation, we will focus on attacks that compromise the
confidentially or integrity of the web application's data.
