  \caption[Sample web application with server-side code and a
    database.]{Sample web application with servers-side code and a
    back-end database. In (1), the web browser makes an HTTP request
    to the web application. Then the server-side code can issue one or
    more SQL queries to the back-end SQL database, shown as (2). The
    SQL server returns the data in (3), which the web application will
    use to generate an HTTP response with HTML, as in (4).}
